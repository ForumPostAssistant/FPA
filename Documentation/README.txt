General Information on the FPA Script:

The Forum Post Assistant has been designed to assist newcomers to the forum to be able to post relevant system, instance, php and troubleshooting information directly in to a pre-formatted forum post. This should save a few hours of posting back and forth, asking for, and explaining how to acquire useful information in order for other forum users to help troubleshoot a problem.
This process also means that consistent information is gathered and presented in every case, enabling helpers to quickly target information relevant to the specific problem observed by the user.

The idea is to make the information collection, and subsequent posting, as simple as possible for the end user, a simple script, automatically collects the information when run in a web-browser and presents the user with the option to include or exclude any site sensitive information before "generating" the post [BB]code that can then be copied and simply pasted in to a new or existing forum post with no other interaction by the user required after posting.

Installation:
1. Download the desired archive 
2. Uncompress the downloaded package file on your own computer (using WinZip or a native decompression tool).
3. READ the included README file for any special Release notes.
4. READ the included Documentation file for detailed usage instructions.
5. Upload the fpa-xx.php script (replace xx with the language version you downloaded) to your Joomla! Site Root "/" directory. This is the place you installed Joomla and may not be the main root for your server. See examples below.
6. Run the script through your browser by entering: http://www.mysite.com/fpa-xx.php substitute your domain for www.mysite.com and substitute the language version you downloaded for the xx. See examples below.

Examples:
Joomla! is installed in your web-root folder and you installed the English version of the FPA script: 
Upload the fpa-en.php script to: <your-domain-name.com>/public_html/
To run the script:  http://www.<your-domain-name>.com/fpa-en.php 

Joomla! is installed in a sub-directory named "cms" and you installed the English version of the FPA script:
Upload the fpa-en.php script to:  <your-domain-name.com>/public_html/cms/ 
To run the script:  http://www.<your-domain-name>.com/cms/fpa-en.php


Due to the sensitive nature of the some of the information displayed by the FPA script, it should be removed from the server immediately after use.

To remove the script from your website use the delete script link provided at the top-right corner of the page. If using the removal link fails to remove the script, then use your ftp program to manually remove the script or otherwise change the name once the script has generated 
the Site Data and the message has been prepared and posted to the forum. If the script is left on the site, it can be used to gather enough information to hack your site.

FPA from v1.6.0 contains an auto-delete feature, FPA will attempt to delete itself on the next run after 5 days of being installed on your server. Do not rely on this function, best practice would be to remove FPA immediately after use.

Removing the script will prevent outsiders from using it to take a look at how your site is structured and possibly utilize any flaws that may be present.

Warning about enabling strong passwords in J! 3.2.0
Why turn off Strong Passwords that is available in 3.2.0?
This is recommended if you are:
    Developing a site on a server with a php version = or > 5.3.7 and you plan to move it to a production server with a lower php version.
    Moving a website from a server with php version = or > 5.3.7 to a server with a lower php version.
    Downgrading your server's php version below 5.3.7.

	With the release of Joomla! 3.2, the CMS introduced a new feature called, Strong Passwords. The intent was to enhance the encryption of password 
	hashing and storage through the use of BCrypt, thus increasing the security of Joomla! 3.2 user accounts. Bcrypt was not available in the early 
	releases of php 5.3, and with the first releases a bug in the algorithm surfaced. This prompted a change in the later php versions to fix it.

	The Joomla 3 series requires a minimum php version of 5.3+ which unfortunately includes php versions without BCrypt and the buggy first release 
	of BCrypt. The Strong Passwords feature has built in compatibility to determine if BCrypt is available based on a php version check of the 
	Joomla installation's server. The version check is used to determine exactly what the Strong Passwords feature would enable, BCrypt or the next 
	best available password hashing encryption available. Unfortunately, this can lead to access issues under certain circumstances and is causing 
	some users deploying new sites to get locked out of their site with no easy solutions to restore access.
	
	Because of the possible issues with some versions of PHP, the FPA script will flag versions of PHP 5.3 earlier than 5.3.7 as being Buggy versions.
	If your site is using J! 3.2.0 version, then PHP Supports J! 3.2.0 field will contain NO if the version of PHP is less than 5.3.7.
