This multilanguage branch contains the scripts that create a single, multi language capable, file from a set of PHP files. 
How does it work ?
It basically scans the PHP code for translatable strings, creates or updates language files, and then builds everything into a single file.

Advantages:
    By providing language files in a standard language file format, things should become a bit easier for fellow translators.
    By splitting up the PHP code into several files it should become more maintainable.
