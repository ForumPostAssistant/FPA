### Forum Post Assistant (FPA)
***
The **_Forum Post Assistant_** has been designed to assist newcomers to the forum to be able to post relevant system, instance, php and troubleshooting information directly in to a pre-formatted forum post. This should save a few hours of too'ing and fro-ing asking for, and explaining, how to acquire useful information in order to help troubleshoot a problem.
***

This process also means that consistent information is gathered and presented in every case, enabling helpers to quickly target information relevant to the specific problem observed by the user.

The idea is to make the information collection, and subsequent posting, as simple as possible for the end user, a simple one page script, automatically collects the information when run in a web-browser and presents the user with the option to include or exclude any site sensitive information before "generating" the post [BB]code that can then be copied and simply pasted in to a new or existing forum post with no other interaction by the user required after posting.

#### Multilanguage Version
This multilanguage branch contains the scripts that create a single, multi language capable, file from a set of PHP files. 

How does it work ?

It basically scans the PHP code for translatable strings, creates or updates language files, and then builds everything into a single file.

Advantages:

* By providing language files in a standard language file format, things should become a bit easier for fellow translators.
* By splitting up the PHP code into several files it should become more maintainable.

This is a "**work in progress**" so let us know if you have questions or wish to help in some way.
